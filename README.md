# cypress-desafio-winnin

Sample project for a challenge testing required.

## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions v20.11.0 and 10.2.4 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation
Run 'npm install' (or 'npm i' for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
You can run the tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport

### Desktop
Run 'npm test' (or 'npm t' for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on a desktop viweport.

Or, run 'npm run cy:open' to open #press in interactive mode on a desktop viewport.
